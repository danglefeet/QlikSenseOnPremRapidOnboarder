# QlikSenseOnPremRapidOnboarder
Welcome to the Qlik Sense On Premise Rapid Onboarder.  The goal of this script is to standup and deploy all needed AWS resources to host a Qlik Sense server solution on AWS in as short amount of time as possible.  This script is currently in test mode.  It uses small ec2 nodes not normally designed to handle full Qlik Sense BI server specs.
